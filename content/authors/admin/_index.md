Welcome to my website! Thank you for visiting.

I am an economic sociologist, a postdocatoral fellow researcher at the Smart Prosperity Institute, and a sessional lecturer at the University of Ottawa, Canada. I design equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) solutions and tools to assist Canadian policymakers in identifying best paths to transition to a decarbonized, sustainable, and more equitable future.

**Research**

My research lies at the intersection of economic sociology, organizational analysis, and inequality regimes. Currently, I conduct research on the EDI dimensions/requirements necessary to achieve a just decarbonization transition, one that leads to clean *and* inclusive economic growth. I design research, solutions, and tools for Canadian policymakers to set in motion a prosperous, sustainable, and equitable path towards a greener economy.

Previously, at SPI, I researched the benefits to human health associated low-carbon infrastructure projects, with a focus on identifying sustainable solutions to decarbonize the economy, improve social and health outcomes, and increase economic performance. 

During my PhD, I investigated entrepreneurship building programs and the emergence of the economic category of ‘the entrepreneur’ in Brazil. I also have experience researching climate change governance in Canada and Australia, knowledge translation and mobilization, and political scandals. My work has been published in anglo and lusophone peer-reviewed journals.

**Teaching**

My teaching philosophy builds on an approach that links sociological theories and concepts to students’ lived experiences. I trust it is important to make sociological work 'feel concrete and relevant' to current social problems. I am a firm believer in the power of data and evidence-based arguments. As such, a portion of my lectures and teaching materials is devoted to teach data interpretation and visualization. My courses include *Local and Global Economic Relations*, *Globalization: Sociological and Anthropological Approaches*, *Sociology of Work and Organizations*, *Globalization and Environment*, *Economic Anthropology*, and *Contemporary Sociological Theory*.

**Passions and hobbies**

I am passionate about the statistical language programming R, open-source philosophy, and creating an inclusive and diverse knowledge community.

Want to start a conversation with me? Ask me about my favourite hobbies and life interests: motorcycles, gardening, coding in R, cross-stitching, universal literature, indie movies, jazz, and dogs (especially whippets).
